Randomizeitor
=============

Randomizeitor is a simple GNOME wallpaper randomizer created by Fidel Ramos (aka
haplo) because, shockingly, there wasn't anything up to the task already. Sure,
there were some scripts here and there, but I wanted more control.

I was inspired by a script by Kevin Bridges: http://kevinbridges.org/node/60

Randomizeitor is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 (see COPYING).

Go to http://github.com/haplo/randomizeitor for the latest version.

Usage
-----

Just run the script passing the path to the directory with the wallpapers,
for example::

  python randomizeitor.py ~/wallpapers/

or if randomizeitor.py is executable::

  ./randomizeitor.py ~/wallpapers/

Randomizeitor will filter the files to select only images. Also, randomizeitor
writes a *.randomizeitor* hidden file in the wallpaper dir to remember which
wallpapers have already been picked, to avoid repetitions.

You can use *gnome-schedule* or a cron job for periodic random wallpaper
changes.

If you only want a wallpaper change at GNOME start you can set it up at
*System->Preferences->Startup Programs*.

Dependencies
------------

 * Python 2.5

Future features
